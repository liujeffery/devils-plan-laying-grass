# devils-plan-laying-grass
A code emulator of Laying Grass, the fifth main match game of the Netflix show The Devil's Plan.
This code was created as part of an event for a university club.

The game is slightly modified from the original version, as it supports six players instead of nine.
- The board size is 20 x 30 tiles instead of 30 x 30
- The placement of special tiles have been moved according to the change in board size
- The number of pieces has been reduced to 60, instead of the original 96

## Prerequesites:
The only prerequesite is that PySimpleGUI and Pillow are installed.

## Instructions for play:
To rotate the pieces or change the colour depending on the round/team, please right click the pieces.

I hope you enjoy the game!
